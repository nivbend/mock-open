# This file was adapted from CPython's `Lib/unittest/test/testmock/testmock.py` which is licensed
# under the PSF license agreement.
#
# In accordance with the license, these are the major changes made to file:
#  * Any tests or code not directly used to test `unittest.mock.mock_open` was deleted.
#  * Instead of using `unittest.mock.mock_open`, the mock-open library's `MockOpen` was imported
#    instead as `mock_open` to keep changes to the test code minimal.
#  * Where there were functional differences between `unittest.mock.mock_open` and `MockOpen` the
#    tests were modified to accomodate the latter rather than the former. These were mostly around
#    `MockOpen`'s constructor requiring a "path" argument and `FileLikeMock`'s  `__exit__` calling
#    `close` on the underlying file-like object.
